## Description: 
APP can take three inputs from the user: 
```
    - City
    - Start Date
    - Finish Date
```
This will make asynchronous fetch into different calls from 4 API's that will make a DIV card with all the data in just one step.
The data will return into a CARD in the HTML project to show the client the info of the travel plan.

This APP is responsive and will work great in any device.
